   Foreword
  </span>
 </h1>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sound is all around us, but truly understanding it requires more than just hearing. When I first set out to study sound scientifically, I found myself lost between dense physics textbooks, fragmented youtube tutorials, and a mess of scattered research papers. Each source seemed to assume the reader either already knew too much or had endless time to piece things together. I had neither.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   This e-book was born out of that frustration and the desire to make the journey easier for the next person. Whether you're a student curious about wave physics, a teacher looking for accessible demos, or just someone who wants to see and hear how sound works, this guide is for you.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   By bridging the gap between academic theory and practical exploration, I hope this resource becomes more than just a manual. May this book not only help you learn, but also encourage you to ask better questions, try new methods, and discover the beauty of physics in sound.

   1.1 Waves and Types
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another without the permanent displacement of the medium’s particles. Waves can be classified based on their motion:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <img alt="" src="images/transverse_longitudinal_wave.gif" title=""/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Longitudinal Waves: The displacement of particles is parallel to the wave’s direction of travel (e.g., sound waves in air, seismic P-waves). A longitudinal wave can be represented as a transverse graph, where the compressed regions correspond to the peaks and the rarefied regions correspond to the troughs (See Chapter 2).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Transverse Waves: The displacement of particles is perpendicular to the wave’s direction of travel (e.g., water waves, light waves, seismic S-waves).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Surface Waves: A combination of longitudinal and transverse waves that occur at the boundary between two media (e.g., ocean waves).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The nature of a wave determines how it interacts with its surroundings, influencing phenomena such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference.

 <h3 id="h.nzmaluep2ifu">
  <span>
   2.1 Fundamental Wave Properties
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   The behavior of waves can be described using several key properties:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <img alt="" src="images/ebook_8-wave-characteristics.gif" title=""/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wavelength (λ): The distance between two consecutive crests (in transverse waves) or compressions (in longitudinal waves).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Frequency (f): The number of oscillations per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Amplitude (A): The height of the wave, related to the loudness of the sound. A greater amplitude corresponds to a more intense wave.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wave Speed (v): The rate at which a wave propagates through a medium, calculated using the formula:
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="equations/image1.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.m6vouwms2lij">
  <span>
   2.2 Energy Transfer in Waves
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Waves transport energy without transporting matter. The amount of energy a wave carries is directly related to its amplitude. For example, louder sounds have higher energy due to greater particle displacement. The intensity (I) of a wave is given by:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="equations/image2.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   where P is power, and A is area. Intensity is measured in Watts per square meter (W/m²) and follows the inverse square law, meaning sound intensity decreases as distance increases.
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.ts6u105ceqkg">
  <span>
   2.3 Superposition and Interference
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   When two or more waves interact, their displacements add together through superposition. This results in different types of interference:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <img alt="" src="images/packet_destruction.gif" title=""/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Constructive Interference: When waves combine to produce a larger amplitude. Example: louder sounds in certain locations at a concert hall.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Destructive Interference: When waves combine to cancel each other out. Example: noise-canceling headphones using inverted sound waves to eliminate noise.
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.pgm2aehm60ao">
  <span>
   2.4 Reflection, Refraction, and Diffraction
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   <img alt="" src="images/final_light_behaviors.gif" title=""/>
  </span>
  <span>
   Reflection: Waves bounce off surfaces, following the law of reflection (equation)
   <br/>
   ex) echoes
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Refraction: Waves bend when they change speed due to moving between different media. ex) sound bending over a lake at night due to temperature differences.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diffraction: Waves spread out after passing through a small opening or around an obstacle. ex) hearing sound around a corner.

  <span>
   3.1 Derivation of the Wave Equation
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   To understand how waves propagate, we use the fundamental wave equation. It describes the motion of waves in a given medium. The one-dimensional wave equation is given as:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="equations/image3.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Where:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="equations/image4.png"/>
  <span>
   : displacement of the medium
   <br/>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image5.png"/>
  <span>
   : speed of the wave
   <br/>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image6.png"/>
  <span>
   : position
   <br/>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image7.png"/>
  <span>
   : time.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   (video)
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   This equation is derived from Newton’s second law and Hooke’s law for elastic media. It applies to sound waves, light waves, and even water waves under certain conditions. A deeper understanding of this equation allows us to model real-world wave behaviors.

 <h3 id="h.7mjhntct4c6d">
  <span>
   4.1 Doppler Effect and Practical Applications
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Doppler Effect describes how the frequency of a wave changes when the source and observer are in motion relative to each other:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="equations/image8.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Where:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="equations/image9.png"/>
  <span>
   : observed frequency,
   <br/>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image5.png"/>
  <span>
   : speed of sound in the medium,
   <br/>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image10.png"/>
  <span>
   : velocity of the observer(positive if moving toward the source),
   <br/>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image11.png"/>
  <span>
   : velocity of the source (positive if moving toward from the observer),
   <br/>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image12.png"/>
  <span>
   : original frequency.
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Doppler Effect has several uses, such as applications in radar and speed detection (the kind used by police to measure vehicle speeds), astronomical redshift (used to study the movement of stars and galaxies), and medical ultrasound imaging (used to measure blood flow velocities in arteries and veins), all of which are fundamental to enable comfort or ensure health in our daily lives.
  </span>

 <h3 id="h.b2pnajem04pk">
  <span>
   4.2 Acoustic Resonance and Harmonics
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Resonance occurs when a system oscillates at its natural frequency due to an external periodic force. This happens because waves transport energy (as explained in 2.2). When an object is subjected to a wave, it absorbs the energy and starts vibrating (or vibrates at a larger amplitude). This phenomenon is essential in:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Musical Instruments: String and wind instruments rely on resonance to amplify sound.
   <br/>
   Architectural Acoustics: Designing concert halls to optimize sound quality.
   <br/>
   Structural Engineering: Avoiding destructive resonance in buildings and bridges.
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.ne44y9ho6ks2">
  <span>
   4.3 Sound Propagation in Different Media
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   The speed of sound changes based on the medium. For example, below are some of the speeds of sounds through different media:
  </span>
 </p>
 <table>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
    <p>

  <tr>
   <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

   <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

   <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
    <p>
     <span>
      ~5,960 m/s
     </span>
    </p>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <p>
  <span>
   This is because in general, the velocity of a wave depends on the inertial property and elastic property of the medium:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
  <img src="equations/image13.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thus, the equation for the speed of sound in different media differs as in the examples below:

   Once loaded, you’ll see a waveform display. This is a visual representation of how sound amplitude (volume) changes over time. You can zoom in using Ctrl+1 or View &gt; Zoom In to examine the fine structure of the wave.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To analyze the frequency components of a sound (which is critical for studying resonance or modulation), highlight a segment of the waveform and then go to Analyze &gt; Plot Spectrum. A window will pop up showing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of that segment. You can change the FFT size (1024, 2048, etc.) to increase resolution; larger FFT sizes provide finer frequency detail but may blur time-based changes.

   . Once opened, you can import a file by selecting File &gt; Open and choosing your WAV or FLAC recording (MP3 is not supported). The program then allows you to view your audio in multiple ways. The default is a waveform, but for frequency analysis, go to Pane &gt; Add Spectrogram.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The spectrogram shows time on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and amplitude as color brightness (usually yellow for strong sounds, purple/black for weak). This is incredibly useful for detecting how sound frequencies appear, fade, or shift over time (perfect for experiments involving resonance, modulation, or frequency drift).
  </span>

   3. Adobe Audition: Best for high-resolution, professional analysis
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Adobe Audition is a paid, professional-grade audio workstation. It comes with advanced tools for recording, editing, and analyzing sound in high resolution. After opening the program and importing your sound (File &gt; Open), you can view both the waveform editor and the spectral frequency display simultaneously. To toggle between them, click the buttons in the top-left corner of the waveform window or press Shift+D to enter the spectral display mode.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the spectral view, time is along the x-axis, frequency along the y-axis, and brightness shows intensity, just like in Sonic Visualiser, but with much higher resolution and better color control. You can also zoom in and analyze individual frequency bands by selecting them with the marquee tool. In addition, Audition allows for real-time FFT spectrum analysis. Go to Window &gt; Frequency Analysis, play your audio, and you’ll see the spectrum shift dynamically in sync with playback.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To export your data, you can either take high-resolution screenshots or use the built-in tools to generate CSV data from spectral plots (though this requires some manual work). There are also precise effects and tools to isolate harmonics, remove background noise, and measure delay times.

   4. Python (with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib): Best for customizable, code-based analysis
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   If you’re comfortable with coding or plan to expand your project into deeper research, Python gives you full control over the analysis process. Start by installing the necessary packages using pip:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To analyze a WAV file, you can use scipy.io.wavfile.read() to load your data. From there, you can plot the raw waveform (amplitude vs. time) using matplotlib.pyplot, and then use the numpy.fft module to compute the Fast Fourier Transform for frequency analysis. For example, plotting the FFT will allow you to customize windowing functions, adjust resolution, or even overlay multiple frequency domains for comparison.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   You can also generate your own spectrograms using scipy.signal.spectrogram() or matplotlib.pyplot.specgram(). These let you tune parameters like FFT size, overlap, and color scaling to match your needs. Python’s power lies in the fact that you can automate batch comparisons, integrate physical equations, and even apply machine learning models if you go far enough.

Start with Audacity to get a feel for basic waveform behavior, then move to Sonic Visualiser or Python to explore deeper. The goal is always to connect your raw sound data with the wave theory you’ve learned earlier in this book.

   Our experiment was conducted by rotating a metal bowl in a circular motion while striking it with a consistent pendulum-like tool. We used a bowl filled with either 20mL or 100mL of water, and sound was recorded in both moving and still conditions. The setup ensured that only the water’s motion varied while all other factors remained consistent. The sound data was then analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and spectral frequency analysis to compare how motion altered wave behavior.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
  <span>
   <img alt="" src="images/ebook_figure1.png" title=""/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the time-domain waveform (Figure 1), we observed that when the water was in motion, the aftermath of the collision-the wave pattern following the initial impact-had a significantly higher amplitude and began sooner than in the still water condition. This phenomenon shows that energy coupling between the bowl and the fluid intensified the transmission of vibrational energy, likely due to dynamic pressure feedback from moving water. Since the moving water altered the mass distribution in real time, it influenced the bowl’s vibrational response, shortening the delay and amplifying the aftermath wave. This highlights how wave superposition and constructive interference between mechanical and surface waves can enhance the overall amplitude.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In a separate analysis of the frequency domain (Figure 2), FFT data revealed that specific frequency bands-particularly between 2000Hz and 4000Hz-were amplified when the water was rotating. This phenomenon indicates that moving water can trigger higher-order vibrational modes in the metal bowl. These modes might not be as strongly excited in the still condition. The presence of motion introduces irregular forces and modulates the bowl’s surface oscillations, which, according to wave theory, can shift energy into new harmonic ranges through nonlinear resonance.
  </span>
  <span>
   <img alt="" src="images/ebook_figure2.png" title=""/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <img alt="" src="images/ebook_figure3.png" title=""/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Additionally, in the spectrogram comparison (Figure 3), we saw brighter regions-particularly yellow-appearing more strongly in the high-frequency zones when water was moving. Since spectrogram color intensity corresponds to amplitude, this supports our earlier findings by showing that acoustic energy was greater and more sustained in the presence of fluid motion. This aligns with the idea that surface waves in the liquid act as modulators, enhancing or redistributing wave energy in the coupled system.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Together, these results demonstrate the dynamic and rich interaction between vibrational modes in solids and wave behaviors in fluids. Moving water doesn’t just passively dampen sound-it actively reshapes the wave output by altering the system’s boundary conditions, resonance, and interference patterns.

   VII. Experimental Notes
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before diving into any wave experiment, it’s important to understand the fundamental habits and practices that make an experiment reliable, repeatable, and meaningful. These notes aren't tied to any one project—instead, they’re general guidelines that apply to almost all sound or wave experiments, whether you're working with a vibrating bowl, tuning forks, or digital simulations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.yibbv3537qpi">
  <span>
   1. Start With a Clear Question
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Every experiment should begin with a guiding question or hypothesis. Instead of "let's just try this and see what happens," ask something specific like:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Does changing the amount of water affect the resonance frequency?"
   <br/>
   "Will rotating the bowl change the waveform's amplitude?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A clear question helps you choose what data to collect and what patterns to look for.
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.2hvzbmttwrgh">
  <span>
   2. Control Your Variables
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only change one variable at a time. For example, if you're testing how water volume affects resonance, keep the bowl size, striking force, and location the same each time. Otherwise, it’s impossible to tell which factor caused the change in sound.
   <br/>
   Common variables in wave experiments include:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Material (metal, glass, etc.)
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tension (for strings)
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Medium (air, water, etc.)
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Force applied
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Distance from microphone or sensor
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.ojln1ndpfhtf">
  <span>
   3. Use Consistent Equipment
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Always use the same microphone, same phone, same bowl, or same speaker when comparing different trials. Even small differences in hardware can change the results, especially in audio recordings. Keep track of your setup using photos or drawings in your lab notes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.wrxvxolq5iz6">
  <span>
   4. Record Everything
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Even if something seems unimportant, write it down. The exact angle of the bowl, the temperature of the room, or how much pressure you applied when holding something—all of this can matter more than you expect. You might not realize it until you’re comparing two trials and wondering why they turned out differently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Write things like:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Used metal bowl, 100mL water, struck with rubber-tipped rod"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Recorded with iPhone 11, placed 30cm away from bowl"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Water was vibrating slightly from prior motion"
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.80ngkde8oppt">
  <span>
   5. Repeat the Trial
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   One test is never enough. Even two or three can be unreliable. If you really want to prove that a pattern is real and not just coincidence, aim for at least
  </span>
  <span>
   five
  </span>
  <span>
   trials per setup. Average the data if needed, or look for consistent trends.

   6. Record in a Quiet Environment
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Background noise is one of the biggest problems in wave experiments. It adds random frequencies into your data and makes analysis harder. Try to record in a quiet room, and if possible, during a time when there’s minimal vibration or foot traffic.
   <br/>
   Tip: Clap your hands once and record the sound. If the waveform shows extra background hum or echo, your room may not be ideal.

   7. Analyze with a Plan
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Don’t just look at the graph and guess what it means. Ask:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Is the peak amplitude higher in this trial?”
   <br/>
   “Is the frequency range wider or more compressed?”
   <br/>
   “Did the resonance take longer to fade out?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Use these guiding questions while comparing FFT plots, waveforms, and spectrograms.
   <br/>
  </span>

   8. Know That Error is Normal
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   You might do everything perfectly and still get weird results. That doesn’t mean the experiment failed—often, it means there’s something interesting going on that you didn’t expect. Write it down. Then, if possible, change just one thing and try again.
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3 id="h.ye5jdtkkq9bn">
  <span>
   9. Save Your Raw Data
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Always keep the original audio files and screenshots of your graphs. If you later need to re-check your work or run a different kind of analysis, you’ll be glad you saved them. If you’re using software like Audacity or Sonic Visualiser, also save project files so you can reopen your session later without losing your settings.

   10. Reflect After You Finish
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span>
   Once your data is collected, take time to think:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   What did you learn from this experiment?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   What would you do differently next time?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   What questions do you have now that you didn’t have before?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   These reflections are often where your next great experiment idea will come from.
